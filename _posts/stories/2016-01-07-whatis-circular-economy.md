The 1950-60’s saw the emergence of an individualistic consumerism in the Western world. With quickly increasing income, people started to access ownership of more and more goods as well as free time to enjoy those purchases. Car possession especially boomed, so that in 1984, the U.S. surpassed the ratio of one car per licensed driver. The 1980’s are also a peak in American’s concerns about environment, and the decade when the concept of “sustainable development” was first defined in the [Brundtland Commission](http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf).

When you cumulate all the environmental impacts (greenhouse gas, acidification, metals…), vehicules may be the number one priority among consumer goods. And among them, cars are the worst. For the same distance, cars contribute four to five times more to global warming pollution than trains and buses, and a bit more than planes. How to fix this? One way could be to improve the product itself - Tesla for instance expects to revolutionize the field with its electric car. But whatever the source of energy - sustainable or not - you still need to produce it in sufficient quantity, and more than everything, you need to produce the vehicle itself. Another way is to develop public transportation, but it doesn’t fit every destination and journey.

A rising solution tends to address consumer behaviours more than the products. Instead of owning your private vehicle to drive to your specific destination, you could share one with people going to nearby places. This is what we call peer-to-peer carsharing, and this is a growing business on every continents - the french Blablacar being the pioneer company. What if you find nobody to share a vehicle? Then, you can then go to a shared car provider just like Zipcar. This is what the sharing economy is: whether it is peer-to-peer or not, you don’t possess a private good, you share it with your local community. And this applies to numerous kinds of goods from washing machines to gardens or houses (Airbnb). Not only does it directly save raw materials and transport, but it also usually improves the quality and life expectancy of a product, as planned obsolescence is no longer beneficial for the provider. 

The collaborative economy as a whole is about all the crowd-based business practices, like crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and to a certain extent slacktivism. It can be applied to tangible goods as well as to non-material services like time, knowledge, funding, skills or experience. The idea is to take advantage of new technologies to bring people together in an optimal way.
