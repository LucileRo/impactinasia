Asia is the largest exporter of textile and clothes, with a share of 58.4% according to the World Trade Organization. The region started to build its leading position in the early 1990’s due to wages far below what they were in Europe, North America, and Japan. While the factories are once more following lower wages from China to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia (56% to 97% of growth in apparel exports between 2009 and 2012), the sector’s ethics do not seem to have changed one iota.

<h3>Unchanged working conditions</h3>

With almost 12 million workers in 1998, Asia already accounted for 72% of global textile and clothing industry employees, paid around 3$ per hour on average (with the exception of Japan at 16 to 20$ per hour), for more than 42 hours of work per week. Programs were developed in the late 1990’s to fight child labour, forced labour and other abuses, but in spite of apparent successes, those practices very often persisted in the informal industry.

Actually, the situation might have even worsened after the end of the quotas in 2005 and the financial crisis in 2008. There are now more than 15 million Asians working in the garment industry, and apart from China, salaries decreased in real terms in most countries. This was especially the case in Cambodia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka between 1988 and 2013. Besides the wage problem, factories allowing trade unions and freedom of association are still very few and far between, while abusive and hazardous working conditions remain the rule. A particularly brutal reminder happened two years ago with the collapse of the Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, with 1138 people killed and more than 2500 injured.

<h3>Modern processes and long term impact</h3>

It would be restrictive to only consider the - although significant - short-term consequences of garment industry. First of all, the production process often involves toxic chemicals with which the workers are in direct contact. For example, the sandblasting method for blue jeans was banned from Turkey in 2009 due to the rising number of workers dying from silicosis or cancer. Out of the 200 millions pairs of blue jeans exported each year from Bangladesh, half of them are however still sandblasted. 

Not only the present methods in textile and clothes industry jeopardize worker’s health directly, but it also has dramatic consequences on environment. It is the third largest water consumer among industries, and accounts for 17 to 20% of the industrial water pollution.  On average, 600 liters of wastewater are needed to produce one kg of apparel. Garment industry is also a major greenhouse gas emitter, even though the contribution varies widely among the type of textile. China, and especially the Jiangsu province, encounter serious pollution problems due to the garment industry. Animal welfare is also at stake when it comes to fur industry, where China is one of the main supplier according to PETA.

<h3>How to solve these problems?</h3>

Some textile and garment industries take the lead, like [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/international) or [Bibico](http://www.bibico.co.uk/), which try to lower both its social and environmental negative impact through organic materials and fair trade. Textile recycling might have one of the highest potential in greenhouse gas reduction amongst other waste - and the activity is already growing. Regarding social justice, some initiatives like [Asia Floor Wage](http://asia.floorwage.org/) or [The Bangladesh Accord](http://bangladeshaccord.org/) are pushing for changes by providing well-documented studies. On that aspect, workers themselves are rising against unfair conditions through unions. Nevertheless, the International Labour Organization (ILO) is still calling the governments - especially Bangladesh - to support this change. Once again, no change is possible without a shift in consumer’s behaviours.
