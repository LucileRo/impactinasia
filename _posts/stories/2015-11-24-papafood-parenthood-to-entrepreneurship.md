When Dan Andrews became a dad two years ago, he wasn’t at all satisfied with the options available on the market for feeding his baby in Vietnam. The best choice for his child’s health would have been to cook his food himself everyday, which he didn’t have the time to do. Assuming he wasn’t the only parent in this situation, Dan realized how promising this opportunity was for a business, and how he could make a living out of his parental concern. That is how [Papafood](http://papafood.net/en/) started.

<h3>A growing market for a growing problem</h3>

This was a well-chosen move, as the baby food industry is currently following a very positive trend in Vietnam. Despite a declining birth rate, the demand for this kind of products is growing day by day, due to richer and busier parents. According to [Market research](http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/baby-food-vietnam-market-report.html), between 2012 and 2018, we can expect an 84% rise in value sales, along with 15% more volume.

But where Papafood is making a difference is in the quality of the product it provides. Originally the holder of an MBA, Dan eventually got trained on childhood development and food safety at the Georgian ChildCare Education Institute, in the United States. He and his team are thus very solicitous about making both nutritive and safe food for babies. That is why they only select organic and local certified ingredients with the most adapted nutrients, all of it cooked with no added salts, sugars or additives. What probably also makes a difference is his inherited family’s passion for cooking. The scientific expertise is here associated to an almost therapeutical conception of food, and a passion for the eater’s delight.

<h3>No quality premium</h3>

Considering all these efforts to provide the ultimate quality product, we could expect the enterprise to be more expensive than its competitors. However, Dan maintains that it is hardly more expensive. As he directly deals with local producers, he doesn’t bear the cost of potential intermediaries. Moreover, as it is a subscription based delivery service, he can benefit from economies of scale, without wasting almost any raw material. All put together the only price premium is that for delivery, which more and more parents are willing to pay due to their shrinking free time. The company is furthermore about to customize its products: the client will soon be able to chose the number of jars, as well as the content and consistence of the food.

<h3>Social or not social, that is the question</h3>

Is therefore Papafood a social business? Dan doesn’t like to define his company as such: for him, business is first, and social second, simply because the latter couldn’t exist without an economically sustainable activity. As he puts it, “we are a social enterprise in the way that we aim to give easy access to healthy food for all babies that can afford it right now [...] but we cannot address social issues at this stage”. Nevertheless, if we widen the meaning of “social”, it is hard not to see a positive impact on challenges like children nutrition and global health or food industry’s contribution to climate change.
