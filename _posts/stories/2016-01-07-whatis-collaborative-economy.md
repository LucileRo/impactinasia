As of August 13th of this year (2015), humanity already spent what nature was able to provide in one whole year. This day is known as the [Earth overshoot day](http://www.wwf.org.au/news_resources/?uNewsID=14400), and fifteen years ago it used to happen in early October. In other words, humanity is hoarding natural debt year after year, and bankruptcy is not that far. Any rational individual in such a financial situation would stop spending that much, and start adopting new behaviours to save money. Well, that is exactly the same idea with circular economy, but humanity-wide.

Today, cities generate 1.3 billion tonnes of solid waste per year, and the amount is expected to rise to 2.2 in 2025 - due to urbanization and an increase of average waste per capita. Why is it a problem? Because at least 52% of it is just left in the open air with no treatment (notice that this only assesses garbage disposal of cities where figures are available). Not only is this a loss of valuable resources, but it also accounts for 5% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. And this is not even to mention clean water waste - a resource half of the world will lack in 2030 - or soil wasted by intensive farming - an activity that accelerates natural erosion by 100 times.

What if we could do things differently? That is what circular economy is claiming through the “3R”: reduce, reuse, recycle. 

Recycling is to some extent the easiest because it is mainly a matter of technology. Take solid waste again: more than 80% of it is in fact recyclable, leading to a myriad of positive impacts in terms of fresh air, water or oil saving. Just like plastic, paper, metal or glass, food waste or livestock’s manure are perfectly recyclable, and the process even has numerous positive by-products like energy, fuel or green fertilizer. Companies like TerraCycle made a business out of recycling what seems un-recyclable. Against common sense, wastewater can be recycled too. Singapore is already meeting 30% of its water demand by cleaning its sewage, and the World Water Council expects it will globally become a normal source of drinking water within 30 years. As for soil, “recycling” might not be the most suitable method compared to sustainable farming practices.

Reduce and reuse are a bit more tricky to implement because everyone needs to contribute jointly. A part of the industry is starting to design its products in order to improve their lifespan, reusability or recyclability: this is called cradle to cradle. Some directly switch to sustainable or biodegradable raw materials, like wood instead of concrete for housing. Consumption behaviours and habits must also change in order to sustainably lower the amount of resource used.

A rising solution tends to address consumer behaviours more than the products. Instead of owning your private vehicle to drive to your specific destination, you could share one with people going to nearby places. This is what we call peer-to-peer carsharing, and this is a growing business on every continents - the french Blablacar being the pioneer company. What if you find nobody to share a vehicle? Then, you can then go to a shared car provider just like [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/). This is what the sharing economy is: whether it is peer-to-peer or not, you don’t possess a private good, you share it with your local community. And this applies to numerous kinds of goods from washing machines to gardens or houses ([Airbnb](https://fr.airbnb.com/)). Not only does it directly save raw materials and transport, but it also usually improves the quality and life expectancy of a product, as planned obsolescence is no longer beneficial for the provider. 

Essentially, circular economy is a new paradigm advocating for sustainable consumption and production practices. This needs everyone to be involved, individual consumers as well as companies and public services. More than new practices, it calls for a new mindset, acknowledging that natural resources are limited, but solutions are not.
