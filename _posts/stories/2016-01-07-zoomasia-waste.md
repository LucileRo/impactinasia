Today, the city of San Francisco, California is very close to its zero waste goal - set up in 2002 and expected to be achieved in 2020. The city recently banned plastic bottles and is already recycling 80% of its waste, a rate no similar municipality has ever attained. The zero waste movement has increasingly spread all across North America and Europe. In contrast, Asia seems to be following a more worrying  trend. 

<h3>The garbage wave</h3>

Among the 1.3 billion tons of solid garbage cities produce every year, Asia is responsible for 340 million tons of it, or approximately 26%. OECD countries are still the main waste generators (44%), even though they only account for 15% of the global population. However, the two groups of countries have two radically different management systems. The OECD collects almost 100% of it, while Asian countries less than 70%, out of which more than ⅔ is often left in open dumps, and only 10% properly managed.

The reality might be even worse as those figures don’t take into account the other 50% of Asians living in rural areas. Moreover, the metrics only pertain to solid waste, as opposed to wastewater, which may be managed even more poorly. Used water is barely treated in Asia: only 10% in Philippines, 14% in Indonesia, 4% in Vietnam and 9% in India. And this remains while 65% of Asians still don’t own a proper household water supply. 

Unfortunately, the situation is not likely to improve in the coming decades. In 2025, the urban population in Asia is expected to be 40% larger than today’s. Furthermore, garbage generation rates per capita are expected to continue to grow along with disposal incomes and consumer purchasing power. For example, China already accounts for 70% of Asia’s municipal solid waste. Given the expected  annual growth rate of 8-10%, China may produce twice as much waste as the U.S. by 2030.

<h3>So what?</h3>

Consequences are numerous and complex, depending on the type of waste and on its location. One of the main concerns is environmental: not only because this inefficient waste management leads to resource scarcity or air and soil pollution, but also because it accounts for 5% of global greenhouse gas emission (and especially 12% of methane production).  

Concern about hazardous waste especially is rising: due to the increasing purchase of electronic goods and the import of e-waste from OECD countries, the amount is expected to skyrocket (about 400% in China and 500% in India from 2007 to 2020), causing severe cases of pollution. With the degradation of environment comes the health issues. A World Bank report is assessing the plentiful diseases and conditions linked to solid waste mismanagement in developing countries, from parasitic infections to cancer. As for mismanaged water and human waste, water borne diseases like diarrhea are killing 2.2 million people worldwide each year.

<h3>How to solve the problem?</h3>

On the public service side, most Asian countries seem to bet on waste incineration - Taiwan, Japan and Singapore already burn more than 90% of their garbage. Philippines have however forbidden the practice, and are exploring alternatives. One soaring all across the world is the biodigestion of organic waste into energy and compost. As for non-organic waste in the region, anywhere from 25% to 75% is potentially recyclable with currently available technologies. Nevertheless, municipalities are often overwhelmed by the waste problem: it usually represent the largest budget spend by low to middle-income cities, sometimes up to 50%. Solid waste management is even more costly since the willingness to pay is rather low. This explains the importance of the informal recycling sector in these cities. Though hard to evaluate, approximately 6 million people are involved in China, and 1 million in India.

Public services can't solve the problem on their own, but rather they need the joined contribution of producers and consumers to transition to a circular economy. “Vigorously develop circular economy” was even the title of a whole chapter in China’s 2011-2015 plan. Some companies in Asia already started to rethink markets in a more sustainable way. For example, the Philippine [Piñatex](http://www.ananas-anam.com/pinatex/) is using pineapple skin instead of animals to produce leather. And this is a transition the young generation is calling for: 86% of Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, and Singapore’s Millennials expect businesses to be actively involved in solving important issues such as economy, environment and health care.
