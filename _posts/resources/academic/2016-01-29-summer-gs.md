The curriculum is based on an engaged and participatory approach to learning whereby students will learn from themselves, Faculty, experts, community-based organizations (CBOs) and NGOs and from Migrants themselves. 

The program focuses on “Border Health” with the aim to raise interest in and appreciate the complexity of global and border health; discover that global health is everyone’s business; and to think creatively about solving problems.
