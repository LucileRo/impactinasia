This program includes 5 months of multiple 'Virtual Classroom' sessions with industry thought leaders and 10 day field immersions on the ground. The DSIL team also develops custom consulting projects and innovative education research. It provides international participants with contemporary tools, a cross sector global social capital network and analogous field immersions focused on personal and professional development. 

‘Design thinking’ is a tool, mindset or methodology for systems or product design and is one avenue to catalyze social innovation- we integrate this approach in DSIL to unleash creativity for the greater good.
