+ Institution: iLeap & University of Washington
+ Website: <a href="http://ileap.org/programs/japan/tomosiis">http://ileap.org/programs/japan/tomosiis</a>
+ Targets: Japanese citizens under 35 years old

This program grows the leadership and cross-cultural skills within the next generation of Japanese (ages 35 and younger) who are committed to social innovation in the production, processing, distribution, and/or consumption of food in Japan. 

It provides these young Japanese with the opportunity to share with a broader, global audience about what they are doing in Japan, as well as learn new ideas and innovation from the Pacific Northwest.
