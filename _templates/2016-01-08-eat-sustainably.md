Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by all the advice regarding food? Climate change, environment, poverty, health, obesity… One might quickly ask “but what can I still eat?”. Here is a reference toolkit to help choose socially and environmentally sustainable food. Conveniently, most of the time these are also the healthiest options.

<h3>Why today's food system is a problem</h3>

The current agricultural system is estimated to account for approximately ¼ of the global anthropic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. It is one of the five most emitting sectors along with energy, industry, waste, and land use, land use change and forestry. Due in part to dependency of food production on climate and environment, the food sector itself is a main driver of the food scarcity crisis to come. 

But GHG emissions are not the only environmental issues raised by today’s food system. According to the Stockholm Resilience Center, the three most crucial “[planetary boundaries](http://stockholmresilience.org/21/research/research-programmes/planetary-boundaries.html)” we are currently pushing are: nitrogen and phosphorus’ concentration into the soil (essential for plants to grow), biodiversity, and land-system change. The two first have reached high risk levels, while the third one is classified as “increasingly risky”. All three at-risk boundaries are closely related to the agricultural system.

The food system is also deeply linked to social issues. According to a 2008 World Bank report, 75% of the poor (under US$1-per-day level) live in rural areas, South Asia having the highest rural poverty level. To get a feel for some of the natural disasters, diseases, price fluctuations experienced by at-risk poor farmers, the game [Third World Farmer](http://3rdworldfarmer.com/) attempts  to immerse the player into the daily life of a farmer family in the developing world.

<h3>Sustainable Diet</h3>

Some ingredients should be eliminated from our plates or at least minimized as much as possible, due to their inordinate impact on the environment.. 

Meat and other animal origin products are the largest offenders on the menu. The livestock sector is responsible for 18% of the total anthropic GHG emissions (i.e. 80% of overall agriculture’s emissions), with lamb and beef contributing the most. These environmental impact estimates are conservative, as they do not include water use and pollution, soil degradation and impacts on biodiversity.

As for fish, the impact on climate change is lower, but the problem is more complex. Many species are at great risk of extinction like Tuna or Sturgeon due to intensive capture. The still-growing demand drives the sector to increase aquaculture, which in turn gives rise to pollution and land-use issues, especially because fisheries now need to get fed.

Worried about getting enough protein in a more vegetarian diet? Don’t be, plants also contains loads of proteins. Patrick Baboumian for example - bodybuilder and Germany’s 2011 strongest man - is vegan, which means he does not consume any animal origin product. Everybody doesn’t need to switch to vegan diet overnight, the Green Monday initiative suggests vegetarian Mondays to start with.

<h3>Buy Sustainably</h3>

Whatever your diet, the same ingredient might have a very different ecological footprint, depending on its production process. 

Foods that stem from industrial farming - using phytosanitary products (e.g. pesticides), antibiotics, monocropping, intensive plowing, deforestation, etc - are recommended to be avoided for multiple reasons. Fertilizer production is the biggest CO2 emitter among farming pre production activities, not to mention the hazardous effects of pesticides on human and animal health. Moreover, the quantity and quality of arable lands have been drastically affected due to these methods: ½ of the topsoil has eroded in the past 150 years alone. 

The main alternative is to consume produce farmed using organic or permaculture methods, which imply no (or very low) usage of phytosanitary products, multicropping, water saving methods or agroforestry. Some reliable organic labels already exist, and are listed country by country by the [IOAS](http://www.ioas.org/certification_body/), a non-profit recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Consuming local is a good way to reduce one’s carbon footprint as well, by avoiding unnecessary transport emissions. When it comes to perishable fresh products, you should favor seasonal ones, and care as little as possible about the way they look.

<h3>Cook sustainably</h3>

Once you chose the proper ingredients, you still have to prepare them - and for your own health as well as for social justice and environment, you’re generally better off avoiding processed food. Processing food requires more transport, more packaging, more energy and more waste: 40% of the food is lost at post-harvest and processing levels in developing countries. Moreover, most processed food comes from big agribusiness companies which squeeze out small farmers and therefore often amplify rural poverty. If you really don’t have the time to cook fresh products, you might consider fair trade processed food as a responsible alternative.

In industrialized countries, more than 40% of food loss happens at retail and consumer levels (worldwide, ⅓ of the food produced is wasted). Therefore, it is strongly recommended to think more about the way you could avoid waste when cooking, by planning meals before shopping, or thinking more about the way you could fully utilize the ingredients…

<h3>Yes, it is tough</h3>

It is difficult to drastically change your habits regarding food, especially if you have a constrained budget. Moreover some of the changes needed are reliant on the supplier to implement, and consumers might feel powerless. Fortunately, initiatives are flourishing online and offline so that eating sustainable is getting easier. We will do our best to let you know about these initiatives in Asia.
