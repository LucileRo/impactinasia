TO BE CORRECTED

Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by recommendations regarding food? Climate change, environment, poverty, health, weight… One quickly might ask “but what can I still eat?”. Here is a synthetic toolkit to help you out choosing socially and environmentally sustainable food. Conveniently, this is most of the time also what is good for your health.

<h3>Why today's food system is a problem</h3>

The current food system might account for ¼ of the global anthropic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. It is one of the five most emitting sectors along with energy, industry, waste, and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Intrinsically related to climate and environment, the food sector itself is one of the main contributors to the food scarcity crisis to come. 

But GHG emission is not the only environmental issue raised by today’s food system. According to the Stockholm Resilience Center, the three most crucial “planet boundaries” we are meeting with are: nitrogen and phosphorus’ concentration into the soil (essential for plants to grow), biodiversity, and land-system change. The two first have reached highly risky levels, while the third one is “only” increasingly risky. But all of them are closely related to the agricultural system.

The food system is also deeply linked to social issues. According to a 2008 World Bank report, 75% of the poor (under US$1-per-day level) live in rural areas, South Asia having the highest rural poverty level. The game [Third World Farmer](http://3rdworldfarmer.com/) gets one immersed into the daily life of a farmer family in the developing world: natural disasters, diseases, price variations...

<h3>Sustainable Diet</h3>

Some ingredients should be eliminated from our plates or avoided as much as possible, whatever their production process. 

Meet and other animal origin products are the first to be wiped off the menu. Livestock sector itself is known to be responsible for 18% of the total anthropic GHG emissions (i.e. 80% of overall agriculture’s emissions), with lamb and beef meat leading the cattle. And this is not even to mention water use and pollution, soil degradation and impacts on biodiversity.

As for fish, the impact on climate change is lower, but the problem is more complex. Many species are at great risk of extinction like Tuna or Sturgeon due to intensive capture. The still growing demand forces the sector to switch from capture to aquaculture, which by essence raises pollution and land-use issues, especially because fisheries now needs to get fed.

Worried about proteins? Don’t be, plants also contains loads of proteins. Patrick Baboumian for example - bodybuilder and Germany’s 2011 strongest man - is vegan, which means he does not consume any animal origin product. Everybody doesn’t need to switch to vegan diet overnight, the [Green Monday initiative](http://greenmonday.org/) suggests vegetarian Mondays to start with.

<h3>Buy Sustainable</h3>

Whatever your diet, the same ingredient might have a significantly different footprint according to its production process. 

Food stem from industrial farming - using phytosanitary products, antibiotics, monocropping, intensive plowing, deforestation... - is for many reasons to be avoided. Fertilizers production is the biggest CO2 emitter among farming pre production activities, not to mention the hazardous effects of pesticides on human and animal health. Moreover, the quantity and quality of arable lands have been drastically affected due to these methods: ½ of the topsoil got lost in the past 150 years. 

The main alternative is to consume organic farming or permaculture, which implies no (or very low) usage of phytosanitary products, multicropping, water saving methods, agroforestry… Some reliable organic labels already exist, and are listed country by country by the IOAS, a non-profit recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 

Consuming local is a good way to reduce one’s carbon footprint as well, by avoiding unnecessary transport. When it comes to perishable fresh products, you should favor seasonal ones, and care as less as possible about the way they look.

<h3>Cook sustainable</h3>

Once you chose the proper ingredients, you still have to prepare them - and for your own health as well as for social justice and environment, you’d better avoid processed food. Processing food implies more transport, more packaging, and more waste: 40% of the food is lost at post-harvest and processing levels in developing countries. Moreover, most processed food comes from big agribusiness companies which squeeze out small farmers and therefore amplifies rural poverty. If you really don’t have the time to cook fresh products, you can at least favor fair trade processed food.

In industrialized countries, more than 40% of food loss happens at retail and consumer levels (worldwide, ⅓ of the food produced is wasted). Therefore, it is strongly recommended to think more about the way you could avoid waste when cooking, by planning better your meals before shopping, or thinking more about the way you could fully use ingredients… 

<h3>Yes, it is tough</h3>

It is difficult to drastically change your habits regarding food, especially if you have a constrained budget. Moreover some of the changes needed are often closely dependant from the supply, and consumers might feel powerless. Hopefully, initiatives are flourishing online and offline so that eating sustainable gets easier. We will do our best to let you know about these initiatives in Asia.
